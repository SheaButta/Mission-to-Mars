# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to assist an analyst scrape data from a Mars NASA and Mars Hemisphere websites.  To complete this task, I used several development tools to extract, transform and load the data into a local MongoDB database.  Once the data was ETL process was completed, I used Flask, HTML, JavaScript and BootStrap to visualize the data and images on a website.  The standard data analysis principles were used which includes; (1) Determine the number of rows and columns in the data; (2) Data types used; and (3) Is the data readable?

## Summary
This project proved that unstructed data can be easily saved in a MongoDB database. With Mongo in my arsenal now and the understanding of collections vs tables, I can can easily work with structed and unstructed data using most database environments in the cloud or on-prem.
